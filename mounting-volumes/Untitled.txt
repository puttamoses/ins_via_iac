df -h

Lists all the block devices in the Linux Machine:
lsblk 

Check if there is any file system on new EBS Volume:
file -s /dev/xvdf
(If you see "Data", meaning you need to setup file system for this block device.)

Create a file system on volume to mount it to EC2:
mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf

Create new directory:
mkdir -p /apps/my-data/apps/volume/new-volume
cd /apps/my-data/

Mount volume to EC2 Instance:
mount /dev/xvdf /apps/my-data/apps/volume/new-volume
